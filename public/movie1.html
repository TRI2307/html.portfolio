<h1>The Best Movie According to Trisha</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Sita Raman</h3>
<p>Very good romantic-emotional movie. Great movie. The performance of all the actors in the movie is very good. People from kids to adults can watch this movie.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie.</p>
<h3>Brave</h3>
<p>Another Great Pixar Film<br/>
    Brave is a film I've been looking forward to since I first laid eyes on it's beautiful trailer. It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn't Pixar's best, but that's holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.</p>
